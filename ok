		what does handling mean i dont know really
		somehow i want a group of information to come that is headers basically
		and that will go in a special block of data in the table

		the other data is just rows of data
		each row comes in and i generate a row in the html and put the data in it


	finish up script that packages up data 
	read how to take that data and share it with the website handler
